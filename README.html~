<p><br><b>What is in the template directory?</b>
<p>
<pre>
  station.c	   contains source code of station
  utils.c	   contains source code of utilities
  common.h         header file included by all .c files
  makefile         make file to build station

  goodstation      station executable 
  goodhub          hub executable

  etc              directory of configuration files
  etc/hosts        host names and their ip addresses
  etc/&lt;name>.if    interfaces file of host <name>
  etc/&lt;name>.rt    routing table file of host <name>
</pre>

<p><br><b>How do i test these programs?</b>
<p>

You run the hub first and then  many stations. Here is an example of one
subnet net34, two stations kepler and mercury. In this example, there is
no router and all the stations are  on the same LAN. They can reach each
other directly.
(&lt;terminal1&gt; means work on terminal1, and so on) 

<pre>
&lt;terminal1&gt; % goodhub net34 
&lt;terminal2&gt; % goodstation kepler 
&lt;terminal3&gt; % goodstation mercury 
&lt;terminal2:kepler&gt; % mercury hi, mercury 
&lt;terminal3:mercury&gt; % kepler nice to meet you, kepler 
</pre>

<!--
<pre>
    % goodhub net34
    % station kepler
    % station mercury
</pre>
-->
<p>

  Here is a bigger example  configuration of three subnets net34, net35,
  net36, a router and many  stations tera, peca, birch, kepler, mercury,
  and caesar.
(mercury & kepler link to net34, tera & peca & caesar link to net35, birch link to net36) 

<pre>
&lt;terminal1&gt; % goodhub net34 
&lt;terminal2&gt; % goodhub net35 
&lt;terminal3&gt; % goodhub net36 

&lt;terminal4&gt; % goodstation router 

&lt;terminal5&gt; % goodstation tera 
&lt;terminal6&gt; % goodstation peca 
&lt;terminal7&gt; % goodstation birch 
&lt;terminal8&gt; % goodstation kepler 
&lt;terminal9&gt; % goodstation mercury 
&lt;terminal10&gt; % goodstation caesar 

&lt;terminal5:tera&gt; % peca hi, peca, I am tera 
&lt;terminal6:peca&gt; % tera nice to meet you tera 

&lt;terminal5:tera&gt; % birch hi, birch 
&lt;terminal7:birch&gt; % tera nice to meet you, tera 
</pre>

<!--
<pre>
    % goodhub net34
    % goodhub net35
    % goodhub net36

    % station router

    % station tera
    % station peca
    % station birch
    % station kepler
    % station mercury
    % station caesar
</pre>

<p><br><b>What is there under "etc" directory?</b>
<p>

All the configuration files are under "etc" directory. There is a "hosts"
file containing the  names of stations and their  ip addresses. <b>These
names are only symbolic and they have no relevance to real machines</b>. 
<p>

There is a ".if" file decribing the interfaces for each station. All the
stations except the  "router" has just one interface.  In case of router
we have three interfaces. For each  interface, we have its name, the LAN
it is attached to, the IP address and the hardware address.
<p>

There is a ".rt" file describing  the routing table for each station. In
the example case  given, all the stations have  exactly two entries: one
for directly attached network and  the other for all other networks. The
router has three  entries, one for each directly  attached network. Each
entry  has  destination  address  prefix,  address mask,  next  hop  and
outgoing subnet (effectively outgoing interface). 

<p><br><b>How do i deal with "error : hub already exists" message?</b>
<p>

When  a hub  is  invoked with  'net34'  as the  argument,  it creates  a
symbolic  link  ".net34.info"  to  a  string  that  has  something  like
"alkaid:36137". This  way stations know the  host and the  port on which
the hub is  running so that they  can connect to it. This  is similar to
the way netscape creates a symbolic link "~/.netscape/lock" to store its
whereabouts. <p>

If you get the above  error message, it  means either there is  one hub
running for  that LAN or somehow the  link was not removed  when the hub
exited. If it is  the latter case, then you can get  rid of this problem
by removing the link using "rm .net34.info".
